# Alberta Energy Scraping and Visualization
A continuation of the January 2020 hackathon project (https://github.com/Shanemacisaac/CanDev2020) but focused on Alberta (since they have a nice webpage with lots of tables)  with drill down to the indivudal powerstations and better aggregation
I redid it in R using rvest to scrape the webpage. http://ets.aeso.ca/ets_web/ip/Market/Reports/CSDReportServlet
